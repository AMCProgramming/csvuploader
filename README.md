This project was created by Aaron McCarthy, as a challenge for Swanest

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project allows users to upload CSV files and have them be automatically rendered. It is optimised for both desktop and mobile displays, and should hopefully be fairly straightforward to use.

## Uploading files

To upload a file, simply press the "Upload a CSV file" button. This will open the file manager, and you can navigate towards the CSV file of choice.

## Viewing the CSV contents

Once the upload is successful, it will automatically render the CSV file

## Starting a new upload

In this current iteration, you have two options to start a new upload:

- 1:  The refresh icon    (Appears once you have uploaded a file). Simply click it and it will allow you to start a new upload

- 2: The home icon. In this current iteration, the home icon works identically to the refresh icon - with the exception that it is always present, whereas the refresh icon appears dynamically.

## Contacting Aaron

The last icon on the navigation menu is an envelope. Select this to send an email to Aaron, using your default mail app.
